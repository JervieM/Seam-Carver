# Seam-Carver

Seam-carving is a content-aware image resizing technique where the image is reduced
in size by one pixel of height (or width) at a time. Unlike standard content-agnostic 
resizing techniques (e.g., cropping and scaling), the most interesting features (aspect 
ratio, set of objects present, etc.) of the image are preserved.
